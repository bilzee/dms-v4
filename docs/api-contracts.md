# API Contracts -- Disaster Response Management System

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Base URL (versioned):** `/api/v1`
**Non-versioned endpoints:** `/api/health`, `/api/entities/available-for-assessment`

---

## 1. Overview

This document describes the REST API for the Disaster Response Management System (DMS). The API is built with Next.js App Router route handlers and provides endpoints for managing disaster incidents, assessments, donor commitments, verification workflows, dashboards, reporting, and data synchronization.

All versioned endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1`. Two endpoints (health check and available-for-assessment entities) are non-versioned and sit directly under `/api/`.

---

## 2. Authentication

Most endpoints are protected by the `withAuth` middleware, which validates a JWT token supplied in the `Authorization` header.

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### Token Acquisition

A JWT token is obtained via `POST /api/v1/auth/login` by supplying valid credentials (email and password). The response includes the token and user data.

### Token Refresh

Tokens can be refreshed via `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh`. The current valid token must be supplied in the `Authorization` header.

### Role-Based Access Control

Many endpoints enforce role-based access control. The following roles are recognized:

- **ADMIN** -- Full system access
- **COORDINATOR** -- Operational management, assignment, and verification
- **ASSESSOR** -- Assessment creation and submission
- **RESPONDER** -- Response delivery and verification
- **DONOR** -- Donor portal and commitment management

Permissions such as `MANAGE_USERS`, `ASSIGN_ROLES`, and others are checked on specific endpoints as documented below.

### Unauthenticated Endpoints

- `GET /api/health` -- No authentication required
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login` -- No authentication required (credentials in request body)

---

## 3. Response Format

All API responses follow a consistent structure. Successful responses return a `data` field along with a `meta` object containing request metadata. Error responses return an `error` field.

### Success Response

```json
{
  "data": { ... },
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "2025-05-18T12:00:00.000Z",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "requestId": "uuid-v4-string"
  }
}
```

Some endpoints also include a `success: true` boolean at the top level.

### Error Response

```json
{
  "error": "Descriptive error message",
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "2025-05-18T12:00:00.000Z",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "requestId": "uuid-v4-string"
  }
}
```

Validation errors additionally include a `details` array with field-level error information.

### Paginated Responses

List endpoints return a `pagination` object within the response:

```json
{
  "data": [ ... ],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 20,
    "total": 100,
    "pages": 5
  },
  "meta": { ... }
}
```

### Common HTTP Status Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 200 | Success |
| 201 | Resource created successfully |
| 400 | Bad request / Validation error |
| 401 | Unauthorized (missing or invalid token) |
